  Yet, we are meeting the needs of a Web which becomes more and more useful to society. So, please accept our great thanks for all you do, and our very best wishes for the new year.
  This year we made an animated holiday greeting which we hope you enjoy, as it is an interactive game!</p>

  Warmly, from all of us at the World Wide Web Consortium.
